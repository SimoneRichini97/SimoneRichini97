Hi fellow visitor! ðŸ‘‹ I'm just a guy who has always been attracted by computers and generally everything that regards technology.

This is why I decided to study at UniMi to achieve a bachelor's degree in cyber security and then work as a Software Developer. ðŸ’»

Currently, I'm a software developer at __Flowing, a Claranet Company__; where I'm learning different technologies and acquiring new skills day after day.

During my work, I had the opportunity to develop software with different programming languages: Java, Python, PHP, C#, and React.
